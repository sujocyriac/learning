In this example, the .d.ts file is recognized and utilized by TypeScript through its module resolution and type declaration mechanisms. Here's how the process works:

#### üîç How TypeScript Recognizes .d.ts Files
---
When you import a module in TypeScript, the compiler searches for type information in the following order:

1. TypeScript Source Files (.ts or .tsx): If a TypeScript file is available, TypeScript uses its type annotations directly.

2. Declaration Files (.d.ts): If only a JavaScript implementation (.js) is present, TypeScript looks for a corresponding .d.ts file to obtain type information.

For example, if you have a math.js file and a corresponding math.d.ts file, importing math in a TypeScript file will prompt the compiler to use math.d.ts for type checking.

####  üõ†Ô∏è How Type Checking Occurs

The .d.ts file provides type declarations without implementations. When you import a module, TypeScript uses these declarations to:

- Validate Function Usage: Ensure that functions are called with the correct number and types of arguments.

- Enable IntelliSense: Provide autocompletion and documentation in supported editors.

- Catch Type Errors: Identify mismatches between expected and actual types during compilation.
