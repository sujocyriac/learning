## Q1: 💡 The Light Bulb Puzzle

**Puzzle Description**

🔎 You’re in a room with three light switches. Each switch controls one of three light bulbs in a separate room that you can’t see into from where you are. You can go into the bulb room only once.

**Question:**
> How can you figure out which switch controls which bulb?

**Solution (Perfectly Logical):**

1. 🔛 Turn on **Switch 1 (S1)** and leave it on for 10 minutes.
2. ⏱️ After 10 minutes, turn **off S1** and turn **on Switch 2 (S2)**.
3. 🚶‍♂️ Immediately go into the bulb room.

Now, check the bulbs:
- 💡 The bulb that is **on** → controlled by **S2** ✅
- 💡 The bulb that is **off but warm** → controlled by **S1** ✅
- 💡 The bulb that is **off and cold** → controlled by **S3** ✅
